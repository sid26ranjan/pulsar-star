# PREDICTING A PULSAR STAR

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class.

The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators.

Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).

Machine Learning algorithms used to predict the target in the following dataset are

1-Logistic Regression

2-Random Forest Classifier 

3-Support Vector Classification
